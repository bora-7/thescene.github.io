    <h2>Early Access</h2>
    <p>During the early access phase, users are strictly prohibited from sharing their accounts or login credentials
        with others. Any violation of this clause may result in immediate termination of access to the Application
        without notice and at thescene.io's sole discretion.</p>
    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Application and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property
        of thescene.io and its licensors. The Application is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws
